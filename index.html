        <p><em>Perishable Program Director</em></p>
        <p>I am currently a retail Grocery program director for a local independant grocery chain. Over the years my focus has been instore scratch baking in the Portland and Seattle area. <br />
          This has ranged from cakes, pies and cookies to artisanal breads. I am currently overseeing operations for the Deli and Meat departments in addition to creating programs and systems for the Bakery.
          <br />Creating programs and systems has allowed me to challenge myself and staff to continually find the most effient and effective processes while increasing productivity and consistency in quality.<br />
          <p>I am working on learning and developing my skills to becomming a web developer and create works of art with the ingredients of technology versus ingredients of deliciousness.<br />
            Below you will see my education, work experience and top skills. I have also linked a page to view my hobbies and a contact page.</p>
          <p>As I develop and highten my skillset in the areas of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I will use this as a platform for sharing my growth and knowledge in areas learned.
